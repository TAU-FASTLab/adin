## **About ADIN**

This component creates user interfaces depending on the information collected from the production line devices and the userâ€™s profile. By doing so, relevant task and operation specific user interfaces are composed for the user.

It should be noted that if applicable, other interfaces with different functionalities may be developed based on the requirements
