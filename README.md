# **ADIN: Adaptine interfaces** 

## **About ADIN**

This repository is for SHOP4CF Component ADIN which stands for Adaptive Interfaces.

ADIN generates user interfaces depending on the user's profile and adaptability features information. By doing so, it enables the visualization of relevant data for assisting the user in different tasks. The interfaces could for example display task-specific work descriptions (e.g, description of assembly operation) to users and enable the user to confirm the completion of tasks for interaction with external components. Additionally, ADIN is connected to other components via FIWARE.

For more information, check the [introduction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw4O7un3cBQ&t=2s&ab_channel=SHOP4CF) about the component.

It should be noted that if applicable, other interfaces with different functionalities may be developed based on the requirements.

This repository aims to be a supportive repository for the component where it could be found documentation, explanatory videos and docker-compose files to start the application.
